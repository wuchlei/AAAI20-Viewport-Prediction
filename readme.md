1. Requirements
    - pytorch
    - s2cnn

2. Training and Testing

As this is my first AI project, so many of the old training and testing codes are easy to use and require refactoring. So this repo only contains the some of essential models. Please refer to this [new project](https://github.com/wuchlei/TMM-Viewport-Prediction) for cleaner codes and many other improvements.
